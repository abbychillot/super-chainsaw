  <p> My most prized posession is one of the  bracelets I wear everyday. This bracelet was given to me by my brother when he
    <br>
    accidentally ordered two of the same one. This bracelet is made out of recycled plastic from the ocean. He has a blue one
    <br>
    and I have an orange one. The bracelet is 3.5 inches tall and 3.5 inches wide. It is a bumpy texture and weighs about 0.0025
    <br>
    lbs. The bracelet is made out of plastic and is only .5 years old. It is circular and does not have a smell. The bracelet
    <br>
    is flamable, but also very durable. My brother got the bracelet for 20 dollars, but if I were to sell it, I would sell
    <br>
    it for 200 dollars. I would sell it for that price because the bracelet means a lot to me and I wear it everyday.</p>
